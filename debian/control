 Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on
 the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's
 build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.
 .
 This package contains the metadata (POM file) used by Maven during the build of
 Maven itself and related projects.
